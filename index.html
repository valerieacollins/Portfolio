           <h3> A little bit about me:</h3>
           <p> Born and raised in Denver, CO I have a background in Equine Science and horse training and that evenutally connected to a career in the automotive industry. Weird how things work, right? I launched my unintentional in the auto industry career by starting to deliver parts as I was building my training business. I ended up working my way up to being an automotive service advisor with a Masters in automotive management. In that field, I discovered that I really enjoyed the process of building estimates for my customers and the research it at times required.</p>
           <p> Fast forward to today, where I am a student at Thinkful launching a new career in full stack web development.</p>
