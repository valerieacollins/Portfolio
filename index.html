           <h3> Hi! My name is Valerie Collins.</h3> 
           <p> I live in Fort Collins CO and I am a native to Colorado. I have an interest in developing cool websites with stunning visual effects. What I like to do:
           <ul>
             <li> Camping and traveling</li>
             <li> Collaborate with like-minded developers</li>
             <li> Mountain Biking (both for fun and racing)</li>
           </ul>
        <!--that section was the about me-->
          
           <h3> A little bit about me:</h3>
           <p> Born and raised in Denver, CO I have a background in Equine Science and horse training, and that eventually connected to a career in the automotive industry. Weird how things work, right? I launched my unintentional career in the auto industry career by starting to deliver parts as I was building my training business. I ended up working my way up to being an automotive service advisor with a Masters degree in automotive management. In that field, I discovered that I enjoyed the process of building estimates for my customers and the research it at times required.</p>
           <p> Fast forward to today, where I am a student at Thinkful launching a new career in full stack web development.</p>
